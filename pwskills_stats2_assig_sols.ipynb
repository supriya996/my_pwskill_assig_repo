        "Standard Deviation: It is the square root of the variance. It is a commonly used measure of spread because it is in the same units as the original data. Example: Take two sets A = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and B = [30, 30, 30, 30, 30]. The average of both sets is 30. Range: For set A is 50-10 = 40. For set B is 30-30=0. Variance : For A is 200. For B is 0. Standard deviation: For A is approximately 14.14. For B is 0. This means that the spread of the dataset A is much wider than B, which has no dispersion.\n",

        "Answer: Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution. It indicates whether the distribution is symmetrical or if it leans towards one side. Positive skewness (right-skewed) indicates a longer tail on the right side, and negative skewness (left-skewed) indicates a longer tail on the left side.\n",

Positive covariance indicates that both the variables increase together, while the negative covariance indicates that when one increases, the other decreases. However, it is not scaled and hence gives no idea of the strength of relation and cannot be compared to that with covariance.\n",
        "Correlation: Measures the strength as well as the direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is a standardized measure ranging from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. Use in Statistical Analysis: Covariance provides a basic measure of dependence, but correlation is more useful for determining how strongly variables are related. Correlation is used in regression analysis and to understand the strength of relationships.\n",

        "Outliers significantly affect the mean because the mean takes all values into consideration and gets pulled in the direction of the extreme values, outliers.\n",
        "The median is less affected by outliers as it is based on position, not the extreme values.\n",
        "Outliers greatly increase measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation as the deviations are calculated in reference to the mean, which is shifted. Example: Take the data set [10, 12, 15, 18, 20]. Mean = 15, median =15. Now take the outlier 100 is included: [10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 100]. The mean now becomes 29.16 and median becomes 16.5. The outlier has pulled the mean much more than it pulled the median and it has significantly widened the spread of the data set.\n"
